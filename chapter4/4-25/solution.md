Only once. 

All elements will only be compared with the chosen pivot for the current partitioning step. And once an element is chosen as a pivot, it stays at its designated position and wont be included in the left or right partition. So, once a pair of elements is compared with each other, that pair wont be compared with each other anymore, since one of them is a pivot at that point in time.
