We can create the BFS tree for a v, and note the last processed vertex, u. Once we get the last processed vertex, we can find the number of edges to reach u from v. We can denote this value as f(v). This value is the maximum shortest path from vertex v to any vertex. Create a BFS tree for each vertex v *E* V, and note the maximum of all f(v). This is the maximum of delta(u,v) for each u, v *E* V.
