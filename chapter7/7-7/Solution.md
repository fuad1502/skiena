a. This occurs with a line BFS tree. A line BFS can occur on a line graph or a circle graph.
b. Any graph will have a point in time where all vertices are in the processed state. This occurs when we back up to the root node for the last time, that is when we have finished exploring the whole graph.
c. This occurs in a multi component graph.
