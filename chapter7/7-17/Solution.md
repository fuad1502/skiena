a. If the graph is a tree, the graph is bipartite. If the graph is bipartite, we can choose either color as the vertex cover, and we can be sure that each edge is connected to a vertex in the vertex cover. Which color to choose depends on which has fewer elements.
b. Notice that if we color a tree graph, the colors will switch with each level. By giving a weight that is equal to to the node order, each node will have a weight that is equal to 1 + number of children, except for the root, which will have a weight equal to the number of children. The interesting thing here is that if we choose a level, we don't include that level's children, since it's of different color. However, since we included the weights, it becomes essentially equivalent to including the children as well, but with all weights set to 1. Therefore, whichever level we choose, we will get the same total weights: n - 1.
c. If the weights are assigned arbitrarily, then we have to calculate the total weight of each color set, and choose the minimum.
