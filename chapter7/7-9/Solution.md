a. It will take O(n^2) to iterate through half (due to undirected) the adjacency matrix and constant time to insert each edge, therefore it will take O(n^2) time to convert. 
b. The number of columns of the incidence matrix would be n^2. To simplify access, we could give an arbitrary edge (x,y) the column number `x * n + y`. Forming the incidence matrix from an adjacency list will take O(m+n) time since that's how long it take to read through the adjacency list, and registering an edge to the incidence matrix would take a constant time. This assumes that the array is initialized to zero.
c. It will take O(n^2) time. The reason is that we don't need to read in all the incidence matrix entries for each vertex, we could just check from column number `x * n + 0` to `x * n + n - 1`. Since the other entries would certainly be 0.
